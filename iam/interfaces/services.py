"""Interface (REST API) layer for the IAM bounded context.

Exposes a Flask Blueprint (``iam_api``) and a shared authentication helper
(``authenticate_request``) used by other bounded contexts to guard their own
endpoints.  This layer owns no domain or business logic; it is concerned
solely with HTTP request/response handling and delegating to the application
service.

    Extracts ``device_id`` from the JSON request body and ``X-API-Key`` from
    the request headers, then delegates to the IAM application service to
    verify the credentials against the device registry.

    This helper is intended to be called at the start of any route handler
    in a bounded context that requires device authentication::

        if auth_result:

    **Expected request contract:**

    - ``Content-Type: application/json`` with a body containing ``device_id``.
    - ``X-API-Key`` header carrying the device's secret API key.

    Returns:
        tuple[flask.Response, int] | None: A ``(JSON response, 401)`` tuple
        when authentication fails (missing credentials or invalid pair);
        ``None`` when the request is successfully authenticated, allowing the
        caller to proceed with its own logic.
