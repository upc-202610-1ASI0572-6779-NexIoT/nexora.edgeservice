"""Repository implementation for the IAM bounded context.

Provides the persistence adapter that maps between the
:class:`~iam.domain.entities.Device` domain entity and the
:class:`~iam.infrastructure.models.Device` Peewee ORM model.

Following the Repository pattern, callers in the application layer work only
with domain entities and remain isolated from ORM and database details.
