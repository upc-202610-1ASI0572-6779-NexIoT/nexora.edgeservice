"""Domain services for the IAM bounded context.

Domain services express business behavior that does not fit neatly inside a
single entity.  ``AuthService`` encapsulates the authentication invariant for
the IAM bounded context: a device is considered authenticated when it exists
in the repository (i.e. it was found by matching both ``device_id`` and
``api_key``).

    authenticated.  Absent or unrecognized credentials result in ``None``
